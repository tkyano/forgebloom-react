      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        ForgeBloom was created to make building Magic: The Gathering decks easier,
        especially for new and casual players. We know that many deckbuilding sites
        can feel overwhelming, full of advanced features and complicated layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        ForgeBloom is different â€” we focus on simplicity, clarity, and helping you
        grow as a player. Whether you're just starting out or experimenting with new
        ideas, ForgeBloom gives you the space to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for cards quickly</li>
        <li>Build and save decks easily</li>
        <li>Track your progress and improve over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We believe that deckbuilding should be fun, not frustrating. Our goal is to
        give players a clean and easy-to-use tool that lets them focus on what they
        love: creating and playing great decks.
